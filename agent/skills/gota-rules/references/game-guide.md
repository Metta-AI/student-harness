Two gods sit in opposite-corner forts. Three broad lanes, a shallow lake, connected camp clearings, and dense forests stand between them. Ten heroes, footmen, and towers fight until one god falls.

THE MATCH

## How the arena works

Gods of the Arena is a 5v5 lane battler. Red fields Death Knight, Crossbowman, Lich, Warlock and Berserker. Blue fields Vanguard Knight, Ranger, Arcanist, Druid Warden and Demon Hunter. Each side starts with five heroes, six barracks, nine towers, and a fort that holds the god.

The default arena is 116 by 116 tiles with map seed 54. Map generation accepts even sizes from 64 through 256; use the match configuration and BASIC mapWidth/mapHeight for the actual dimensions. Blue starts in the southwest and Red in the northeast. Roads carve the forest and cross cliffs at short ramps. Each fort has three exits, two barracks per exit, and a separate walled spawn. Match seeds control gameplay randomness without changing this layout.

With the default 480-tick spawn interval, every surviving barracks spawns three footmen every 20 simulated seconds, so each lane sends six per team per wave; they march until they meet the enemy. Destroying a barracks stops its three. Heroes start at level 1 with 150 gold and their full four-ability kit already unlocked. Kills grant gold and XP. Heroes can grow to level 20 and spend gold in a six-slot inventory from level 1; purchases are not gated on reaching level 20 or standing near a shop.

Outer towers fall first, then inner, then the gate. A lane's barracks become attackable once all three of its towers are down. A god becomes attackable after one of its lanes is cleared. The first fort to reach zero health loses. Each winning-team seat scores 1 and each losing-team seat scores 0. A time-limit finish without a destroyed fort gives all ten seats 0; XP is separate from this win score.

| Reference | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Footmen | 60 HP, 12 damage, 15 gold |
| Towers | HP: outer 950, inner 1,300, gate 1,950. Damage: 18, 24, 30 |
| Barracks | 950 HP, no attack; two per lane per team; exposed after the lane's towers fall; 100 XP and 75 gold like a tower |
| Gods | 400 HP, exposed after a lane falls |
| Hero bounty | 150 XP and 100 gold |
| Level curve | 100 XP, then +75 each level |
| Clock | Default 28,800 ticks at 24 ticks/s: 20 simulated minutes; match configuration can differ |

THE ROSTER

## Heroes and ability kits

Each ability shows what it affects beside its artwork. Footprints describe the hit area; visual effects describe its appearance. Arc and cone effects share a sector footprint. Every area spell leaves a warning on the map until impact.

Every hero enters with Q, W, E, and R ready at **level 1** . There is no skill-point tree. Stats climb through level 20. Cooldowns and ranges below use the live HUD units: seconds and tiles.

ACTIONS AND SPELLS

## Aim, cast, impact, recharge

**Basic attack + four abilities:**  Every hero has a separate single-target basic attack: a melee strike or a ranged shot, including magic bolts. Basic attacks cost no mana, use no spell charges, and repeat at the hero's attack speed. Their damage grows every level: base damage + (level − 1) × damage per level, plus equipment bonuses. Q/W/E/R are four additional abilities with their own cooldowns and charges.

### One target

Melee strikes need close range. Projectiles travel to one target. Neither becomes an area attack just because its effect looks wide. In player mode, aim at an object to target it, or aim at empty ground to swing or shoot into space.

### An area on the map

Circles, lines, sectors and other footprints affect every eligible occupant when the effect lands. The area locks when cast. Moving into it before impact can get you hit; moving out can avoid it. Enemy damage, allied healing and structure protection still apply.

### A visible warning

Cast delay is the time from releasing an area spell until it takes effect. The full footprint remains on the map during that delay, then flashes at impact. Every cast uses the same warnings and timing. Changing playback speed speeds up or slows down the battle and spell effects together.

**Mana**  is paid when a cast is accepted. Basic attacks cost zero mana, as does Molten Fist. Other spells have their own mana costs. Invalid casts do not spend mana or charges; a valid shot into empty space does.

### Charges

The number of casts held in reserve. You need at least one charge. Each hero starts with a full set; a respawn restores the set.

### Cast cooldown

The minimum time between uses of the same action, even if charges remain. It is separate from the effect's cast delay and from its recharge timer.

### Recharge cooldown

Charges refill one at a time. The timer starts with the first spent charge. Spending another does not restart it. When a charge returns, the next missing charge starts its own full recharge.

**Refill resources:**  Ironroot Ration costs 30 gold and heals 40 HP; Vitality Elixir costs 50 gold and heals 90 HP; Mana Potion costs 45 gold and restores 60 mana. Buy them in the [shop](https://metta-ai.github.io/polyworld-buff/GOTA/index.html#shop). Healing cannot revive a hero at zero HP.

PLAYER CONTROLS

## Control your hero

This section describes human-control mode. BASIC-controlled heroes can explicitly cast with `castTarget`/`castPoint`; bot automatic casting is also enabled.

Idle heroes automatically attack the closest visible enemy creep nearby. Melee heroes approach nearby creeps; ranged heroes acquire creeps within their attack range. Select an enemy or right-click it to make it take priority. Both melee and ranged heroes move toward that target until they reach their own basic-attack range, then stop and attack repeatedly. When the target dies or is lost in fog, they return to nearby creeps. A ground move order cancels the attack and takes priority over automatic acquisition. These rules also apply with zero mana or all four abilities on cooldown.

You control your four extra abilities; they only cast when you use them. Q/W/E/R cast immediately at your current valid target. Self actions are attempted on key press and affect you when accepted; resource/cooldown rules apply, and full-health healing or full-mana restoration is rejected. Melee actions also fire immediately: they strike a nearby target, or swing toward the pointer when there is none. For other abilities with no valid target, the key selects the ability and right-click casts at an object or the ground. Escape cancels the selection. With no ability selected, right-click moves or attacks. Click SHOP in the inventory, or press B, to open the full-screen item shop; click an item to buy it. Space pauses or resumes the battle, including while shopping. The HUD shows remaining charges and the wait until an empty action can be used again. A blue bar tracks progress toward the next charge.

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Q / W / E / R | Your four extra abilities. Self and melee actions fire immediately; other actions use your current target or select right-click aiming. |
| F / G | Use the first two inventory items, including health and mana potions. |
| O | Toggle character outlines behind scenery. Enabled by default; hidden portions are outlined without revealing enemies in fog of war. |
